# PraxisAI-Hub

## About

Welcome to PraxisAI-Hub, the central repository for my 2024 resolution: #oneweekonesideproject. This year, I embark on a journey to create and share a new side project each week, focusing on AI and its applications in real-world scenarios. This repository serves as a living showcase of my exploration and contribution to the field of artificial intelligence.

## Goals

- **Innovate Weekly:** Launch a new, innovative AI project every week.
- **Focus on Real-World Application:** Ensure each project has practical value and real-world applicability.
- **Learn and Grow:** Use this challenge to enhance my skills and understanding of AI technologies.
- **Community Engagement:** Collaborate, receive feedback, and engage with the AI community.

## Projects

Each week, a new project will be added to this repository. Here's a brief overview:
